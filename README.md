# governance
This repo contains the current state of and process for evolving the cadCAD_org.

forthcoming: see initial_draft branch; contributors welcome.

governance repo ratification process:
- requires all 3 maintainers approval to merge
- maintainers are responsible for administrating rough consensus amongst contributors and community
- contributors voices are given credance with some approximate proportionality to past contributions
- sourcecred instance provides an estimate of past contributions but is not taken as absolute truth

governance repo ammendment process:
- as above with expectation of time lags and discusions in forums
- the time allowed prior to decisions will depende on magnitude of changes in question

good practice in this repo is not to include anything expected to change faster than once everyone few month. However, one can reference other repos such that the pointer does not change, but the thing pointed to may vary more frequently. For example, pointers to the discord and discourse instances.

tldr: git + markdown + access control = constitutional democracy

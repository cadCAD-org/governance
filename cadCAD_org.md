The purpose of this doc is to outline the cadCAD organization at a high level

## Mission

To democratize access to complex system modeling and the proper methods used to create and understand them. 

## Vision

To grow & assist an open source community of data scientists and system designers, and reduce our reliance on black box models from monied interests with misaligned incentives.

## Values

### “All models are wrong, but some are useful” - George E.P. Box

cadCAD continues in the tradition of NumPy, SciPy and other tools for ‘jailbreaking’ scientific & mathematical expertise out of high cost tools & knowledge silos. But tools alone are insufficient to bring this shift about - what is also needed is community, education, experience and value alignment in applying the right models to a given situation. Without tools like cadCAD, we remain at the mercy of those with the funds and capabilities to determine our futures for us. cadCAD puts that power back in our hands, and with that comes the mandate to use it responsibly.

## Overview of decision making processes
(maintainer administrated rough consensus over contributors [details])

The decision making process of the cadCAD organization is one of maintainer administration, aided by rough consensus of contributors and the advice process when necessary. 

## Maintainers 
(short bios including past contributions and current working group involvement)

**Michael Zargham** - The inventor of cadCAD, Z (as he is affectionately known) is involved with most aspects of cadCAD on an ongoing basis. He is an active participant in all working groups: Maintainers, Administration, and Outreach & Education.

**Joshua Jodesty** - The lead developer of cadCAD, Josh is involved with the Maintainers workgroup and is the primary maintainer of the cadCAD repo.

**Markus Koch** - One of cadCAD's most experienced users, Markus has contributed heavily to the development of the tool to this point, and is involved with the Maintainer workgroup.

## Contributors
(list of working groups with summary descriptions of responsibilities and links to outputs, also links to working group folders, link to "contributors" team in cadCAD_org)

cadCAD contributors can be involved in one or multiple working groups, tasked with making cadCAD more effective by building up its People, Processes, and Tools. The working groups that are currently active are listed below:

* Maintainers <link>: this working group focuses on responsibilities such as the cadCAD development roadmap, new features, github issues & bug fixes, contribution guidelines, and tutorials & demos.
* Administration <link>: this working group focuses on responsibilities such as maintaining the cadCAD DAO & FAST tokens, and infrastructure for our Discourse, Discord, and SourceCred instantiations.
* Outreach & Education <link>: this working group focuses on responsibilities such as managing community & content on Twitter, Discourse, Discord, content production & articles, and the upcoming Dynamic Games Seminar.

# Overview of Working Groups

This file to give an overview of how working groups work

working group is jointly responsible for the managing its collective commitments to organization. working groups generally have control over their own decision making processes but are expected to abide some manner of group consensus and are subject to oversight from the larger body of contributors. such oversight and moderation will be in the responsibility of the maintainers but will be excercised only insofar is necessary to manage collaboration accross working groups and the pursuant to the organization wide goals.

one becomes a contributor to cadCAD_org at the nomination of a particular working group. this role related to past contributions and expectations of future involvement. Contributor status is generally coupled with specific access control permissions determined at the working group level, and tend to be specific to the resources maintained by that particular working group.

# Overview of Working Groups

This file to give an overview of how cadCAD working groups operate.

A working group is jointly responsible for the managing its collective commitments to the organization. Working groups generally have control over their own decision making processes but are expected to abide some manner of group consensus, and are subject to oversight from the larger body of contributors. Such oversight and moderation will be in the responsibility of the maintainers but will be excercised only insofar as is necessary to manage collaboration accross working groups and the pursuant to the wider organizational goals.

One becomes a contributor to cadCAD_org at the nomination of a particular working group. This role is related to past contributions and expectations of future involvement. Contributor status is generally coupled with specific access control permissions determined at the working group level, and tends to be specific to the resources maintained by that particular working group.
